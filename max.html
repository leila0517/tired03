<h2>The adventurous photographer hikes to locations that are not highly populated and observes the world from a eye view of birds.
Through his lens, Rive takes viewers on adventures across stunning landscapes and mountaintops, where we are invited to experience the world from an entirely new and creative perspective.</h2> 
<p>To obtain the dynamic compositions, Rive hikes to high perches, withstands very cold temperatures, and greets the sun as it rises over large peaks and glistening rivers.
</p>
<p>He often stitches multiple panoramic shots together to obtain the wide ranges and to capture the overwhelmingly beautiful perspectives from high above the world.</p>
<p>Each photograph emanates with vivid colors and whispers of quiet solitude.</p>
<p>Biography</p>

<br>
<h3> So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. </h3>
